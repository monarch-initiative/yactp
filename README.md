Yet Another Clinical Trials Parser



To run this script, add the names of all relevant items (e.g., protein kinase inhibitors)
to the input file (hard-cided as ``kinase_data/kinase_inhibitors.txt``) for
now. Put one item per line. Then run the script ``run_parser.py``.
It will generate an output file called ``clinical_trials_pki_studies``.
